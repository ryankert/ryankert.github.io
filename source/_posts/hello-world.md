## Why?

I was priviously using jekyll TeXt theme, but the code block shows too small to watch code. Also, I don't really understand the coding language jekyll is using, so I decide to switch to a more familier javascript framework, hexo.

## What is Hexo?

Hexo is a website generator to generate website based on Markdown file, and it is highly customizable.

## Install Hexo

Preriquisite: `Git` and `node.js`.

## Install Hexo CLI

```bash
npm install -g hexo-cli
```

and, we can execute Hexo commands in this way:

```bash
npx hexo <command>
```

**Install Starter Package & Dependencies**

```bash
npx hexo init blog
cd blog
npm install
```

## Server

Run these commands, and you will see a starter website is generated by Hexo.

```bash
npx hexo g
npx hexo s
```

## Writing

In `sourse/__post` folder, we already have a `hello-world.md` post that is from Hexo starter package. Basically, we can imitate that first.

### Example:

```md
---
title: Switching to Hexo!
tags: [Hexo]
categories: [Static Website Generator]
---

# header

your blog post
```

## Theme

You can search for theme you like on [This Site](https://hexo.io/themes/) or Github, but in hexo, I will generally recommand `next`. It's not only because it's highly customizable, but for its already built nice plugins.

## Deploy

Use

```bash
npx hexo g
```

It will generate html file that you might want to deploy to github in `pulic` directory, and you can use Github Pages to handle that.

## Auto Deploy with Github Actions

Baically, you might find it annoying to generate `html` file everytime you want to make a change. Github can handle that for me.

1. Uplaod your whole project to Github.
2. add a file to your repository, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml**

```yml
name: Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # default branch

jobs:
  pages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js 16.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "16"
      - name: Cache NPM dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.OS }}-npm-cache
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.OS }}-npm-cache
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
          cname: # if you use custom domain, enter your hosting domain for this project.
```
