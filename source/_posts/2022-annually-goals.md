Time flows fast, couldn't resist.

Anyways, I find out I only have half of year left (5 monthes), so Imma going to set up some sort of goals that I can look up as days passes.

## Goals

1. Leetcode Ratings : 2000 (if can, try to reach the Guardian badge).
2. CPE programming contest : I think I can acheive 5/7 now, so I'll set a 6 out of 7.
3. Relatively nice GPAs
4. Find an intructor and start a project
5. Create an Fullstack Application
